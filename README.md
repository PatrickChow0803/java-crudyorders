# java-crudyorders

## Introduction

This is a basic database scheme with customers, orders, and sales agents. This is part two of a two part CRUD application.

## Instructions

Part 1 of this project created the database and read endpoints. See the repository https://github.com/LambdaSchool/java-orders.  

Part 2 of this project finished the CRUD application by adding create, updating, and delete endpoints.
